# Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to run JavaScript code server-side, outside of a web browser.

# Asynchronous and Event-Driven: Node.js uses non-blocking I/O calls, allowing it to handle multiple operations simultaneously without waiting for each to complete.

# Single Programming Language: You can use JavaScript for both client-side and server-side programming.

# Fast Performance: Built on the V8 engine, Node.js executes JavaScript code quickly.

# NPM (Node Package Manager): A vast repository of libraries and tools that can be easily integrated into Node.js applications.

# Web Servers and APIs: Efficient for handling multiple simultaneous connections.

# Real-time Applications: Chat applications, online gaming, etc.

# Event Loop: Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model to handle tasks asynchronously.

# Node.js provides several built-in modules that make it easy to perform common tasks. Core modules are part of the Node.js runtime and do not need to be installed separately. They provide functionality such as file system operations, HTTP server creation, and more.
