# Backend development in web development refers to the server-side part of an application. It handles the logic, database interactions, and operations that are not visible to the user but are critical to how a web application functions. The backend essentially connects the front-end (what users see and interact with) to the database and handles all the necessary behind-the-scenes processes.

## 1. Server: A backend runs on a server. The server's job is to process requests from the client (front-end) and return the appropriate responses, such as data or webpages.

## 2. Database: The backend often communicates with a database. It retrieves, stores, and updates data as needed. Common databases include SQL databases (e.g., MySQL) and NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB).

## 3. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces): The backend often exposes APIs that the frontend can call to request data or perform actions. REST APIs are one of the most common patterns in web development.

## 4. Security: The backend manages security aspects like user authentication (verifying user identity), authorization (determining what actions the user can perform), and data validation.

## 5. Business Logic: The backend contains the business rules that dictate how data can be processed and manipulated. For example, calculating total cart values in an e-commerce application happens in the backend.

# Backend with Express.js

## 1. Express.js is a popular backend framework for Node.js, which is a JavaScript runtime that allows JavaScript to be used for server-side development. Express.js simplifies the process of building a server by providing useful utilities for handling HTTP requests, routing, middleware, and more.

# Why use Express.js?

## 1. Lightweight and Fast.

## 2. Middleware: Middleware functions in Express are used to process requests at different stages, such as logging, authentication, or data parsing.

## 3. Routing: Express provides powerful routing to define how different endpoints (URLs) of your web application should respond to client requests.

## 4. Integration with Databases: Express.js can easily be integrated with databases like MongoDB or MySQL to retrieve or store data.

## 5. Handling APIs: It simplifies creating RESTful APIs, making it a common choice for API development.
