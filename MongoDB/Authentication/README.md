# Authentication, Authorization, and JWT in Express.js with MongoDB

## 1. Authentication: Verifying the identity of a user.

## 2. Authorization: Determining the level of access for an authenticated user.

## 3. JWT (JSON Web Token): A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims for securely transmitting information between parties.

## 4. Authentication is the process of confirming a user's identity, typically by validating credentials like username and password.

## 5. Authorization is the process of checking whether a user has access to a particular resource or functionality after authentication.

## 6. JWT (JSON Web Token) is an open standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. It is signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure data integrity.

# Flow of Auth

// Laptop
// Browser
// Register/Signup
// Login/SignIn
// Token (backend to frontend)
// Every request from Frontend will take token to communicate
