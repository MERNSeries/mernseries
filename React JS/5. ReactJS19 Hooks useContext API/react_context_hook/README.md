## The useContext Hook in React allows you to access the context values in functional components. This is part of the Context API, which helps manage and share state across components without having to pass props down manually through every level of your component tree.

# What is Context API?

## Context API provides a way to share values like configuration settings, themes, or user information across your component tree without passing props down manually at every level. It consists of:

### 1. Context Creation: Using React.createContext() to create a context.

### 2. Provider: A component that uses the Context's Provider to pass down the current value.

### 3. Consumer: A component that uses the Context's Consumer to access the current value.
