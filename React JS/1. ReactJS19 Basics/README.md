# React JS

1. JavaScript Library. (Structure of Programs)
2. Single Page Application - Dynamic Content Updation without Reloading Page.
3. Created by Facebook in 2013.
4. Component - based Structure.

## React encourages the use of components, which are small, reusable pieces of code that return a portion of the UI. Components can be nested, managed, and handled independently, making the development process modular and more maintainable.

## React introduces the concept of a Virtual DOM, which is an in-memory representation of the actual DOM elements. When the state of a component changes, React updates the Virtual DOM first, then it compares this with the actual DOM (a process called "reconciliation") and only updates the parts that have changed. This makes React applications fast and efficient.

## React follows a unidirectional data flow, meaning data moves in a single direction through the application. This makes the logic of the application more predictable and easier to debug.

## Why use React JS?

1. Performance: Virtual DOM.
2. Component Reusability.
3. Strong Community.
