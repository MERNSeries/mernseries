# Git & GitHub

## 1. Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code during software development.

## 2. It allows multiple developers to work together, track changes, revert to previous versions, and collaborate seamlessly.

# Key Concepts

## Repository: A folder where Git tracks project changes.

# Version Control: Tracking and managing changes to software code.

# Commit: A snapshot of changes made to files in the repository.

# Branch: An independent line of development.
